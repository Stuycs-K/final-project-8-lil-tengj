## Overview
(to run the code, please download the Sound Class from Processing Library)Our project is a imitate of game Candy Crush. The board contain candies that's randomly placed. There’ll be an objective on the bottom of the screen, updating depending on the amount of candies eliminated. When the player clicks and drags on two candies, they will swap and look for three or more of the same candies in a row and/or column. If they are found, they will be eliminated, and the board will be refilled with new candies from the top. If they are not found, they will switch back. This process repeats until the objective is reached. One thing that we need to look for is to make sure that there are possible swaps in levels that can eliminate candies. If there aren’t, it is necessary to randomize the board until it is possible.

## Instructions
Follow the objective show on the bottom of the screen. Your objective is to eliminate specific amount of same color candies. Make the best move to get closer to your objective. Swap the candy by drag and drop the candy to its neighbor position. Warning! Only the candy that can eliminate the others will be swapped. If you ever encounter the situation where you can not make any move because there's no more candy to eliminate, press "r" key to restart. Hope you enjoy the game!
